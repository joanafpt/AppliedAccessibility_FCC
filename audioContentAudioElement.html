<!--Improve Accessibility of Audio Content with the audio Element-->

<!--Time to take a break from Camper Cat and meet fellow camper Zersiax (@zersiax), a champion of accessibility and a screen reader user. To hear a clip of his screen reader in action, add an audio element after the p. Include the controls attribute. Then place a source tag inside the audio tags with the src attribute set to "https://s3.amazonaws.com/freecodecamp/screen-reader.mp3" and type attribute set to "audio/mpeg".-->
